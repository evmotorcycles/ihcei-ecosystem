# ADG (`C_dev`) & TQG-CFE (`Ψ`) — an empirical telemetry experiment

*The ADG and TQG-CFE equations are **not** physical laws with SI units. Like
`E = U·D` in LISM, they are **organization-graph telemetry**: a way to combine
measurable signals of a network into a scalar that should track its health. This
experiment tests **only** that Layer-1 telemetry reading, on real open-source
GitHub projects. It makes **no** claim about the Layer-3 metaphysical
interpretation (Nafs, Deen, perception), which the framework's own note labels
"a formal analogy, not empirical measurement." The two layers are kept strictly
apart — the same discipline `FLOOR_RETIREMENT.md` applies to LISM.*

## Operationalization — each symbol → a measurable proxy

A repo is a governance network of contributors resolving flagged risk. Per repo:

| equation symbol | telemetry proxy |
|---|---|
| adoption (reach) | `a = ln(1+stars)` |
| throughput `G_ij` (knowledge transferred) | `t = ln(1+closed issues)` |
| responsiveness (enforcement speed) | `r = 1/(1+τ_v)`  (τ_v = LISM enforcement latency) |
| `Φ_Nafs` (practice vector) | `Φ = (a, t, r)`, each min-max normalized to [0,1] |
| `Θ_Deen` (perfect governance) | `(1, 1, 1)` |
| **TQG-CFE `A_n(Φ)`** (alignment) | `⟨Φ\|Θ⟩ / (\|Φ\|\|Θ\|)` — the paper's exact cosine formula, ∈[0,1] |
| **Ψ rendering** | `Ψ_Yusr` (ease) if `A_n > κ`; `Ψ_Usr` (hardship) if `A_n ≤ κ`  (`κ` = median) |
| `ħ_network` (noise) | normalized `τ_v` (enforcement latency = governance-failure noise) |
| `Σ Φ_iΦ_j G_ij` (aligned connectivity) | `a·t` (breadth × depth of transfer) |
| **ADG `C_dev`** | `A_n · (a·t) / (ε + ħ_network)` |

**The outcome `E` is measured independently**: `E=0` (failed) if archived or no
push in >365 days, else `E=1` (survived). Push-date/archived are **not** inputs to
`A_n` or `C_dev`, so predicting `E` from them is a genuine test, not a tautology.

## Falsifiable predictions and results (22 real repos, 16 survived / 6 failed)

| prediction | result | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **H1 (ADG):** survived repos have higher `C_dev` | 3.19 vs 1.18, 1-tailed MWU **p=0.033** | supported |
| **H2 (TQG):** survived repos have higher alignment `A_n` | 0.860 vs 0.727, **p=0.018** | supported |
| **H3 (TQG):** `Ψ`-rendering at `κ` predicts survival | `Yusr` 90% survive vs `Usr` 58% | supported |

**3/3 on this cohort.** The Mann-Whitney U is computed in pure stdlib (the same
routine validated against `scipy` in `repro/`); the p-values are conservative.

## Honest scope

- **Correlational, not an oracle**, and a small cohort. The operationalization
  makes real errors: `angular/angular.js` is *archived* (`E=0`) yet scored high
  `A_n`/`C_dev` (`Yusr`) because it froze its issue queue while responsive — a
  genuine false positive that shows the proxy is a signal, not a certainty.
  `less.js` is the opposite (alive but slow → `Usr`). Those edge cases are why
  the separation is significant-but-imperfect, which is the honest state.
- **It recovers and extends LISM.** Because responsiveness `r` embeds `1/(1+τ_v)`,
  the experiment re-derives the LISM enforcement-latency signal through the
  ADG/TQG lens and adds adoption + throughput structure. That's the expected,
  coherent result — the ADG C_dev is a superset of the τ_v hazard read.
- **Layer 1 only.** This tests the telemetry. It neither supports nor refutes any
  metaphysical claim in the framework; those are explicitly out of empirical scope.

## Enriched retest — governance terms as engineering telemetry

`python3 adg-tqg/experiment_enriched.py` operationalizes the author's term-level
definitions, each as a **measurable** governance/engineering signal (no theology;
`Shirk` here is an epistemic-conflation *metric*, "not a sin"):

| term | engineering proxy |
|---|---|
| **Salat** = `D_enc` (encode/alignment hop) | responsiveness `1/(1+τ_v)` |
| **Zakat** = `D_dec` (decode/transfer hop) | throughput `ln(1+closed issues)` |
| **D** = `Salat·Zakat` | two-hop fidelity (exactly LISM's `D_enc·D_dec`) |
| **Deen** = Established Order | governance target `Θ = (1,1,1)` |
| **Shaytan** = internal disposition | internal noise `ħ = normalized τ_v` |
| **Shirk** = epistemic conflation | `\|σ\|`, the LISM say-do Dissonance |
| **Iman** = safety/security | the **rendered** Yusr outcome (aligned + coherent) |
| **Ψ_Chaos** | `\|σ\|` (Shirk) dominates — the network mislabels its own state |

**Results (same 22 repos):**

| prediction | result |
|---|---|
| **H1 ADG `C_dev`** | surv 1.40 vs fail 0.30, p=0.025, **AUC 0.78** |
| **H2 TQG `A_n`** | surv 0.86 vs fail 0.73, p=0.018, **AUC 0.80** |
| **H4 two-hop `D=Salat·Zakat`** | surv 0.119 vs fail 0.042, p=0.028, **AUC 0.78** |
| **H3 Ψ rendering** | **Yusr 9/9 survive**, Usr 3/7, Chaos 4/6 (the mislabeled set) |
| **H5 Shirk detector** | among fresh-pushed repos, high-Shirk "zombies" τ_v **67.6 vs 6.2, p=0.0013** |

**4/4 core predictions, and the enrichment measurably improves the model:** the
`Ψ_Chaos` (high-Shirk) class isolates the deceptive repos — `angular.js`
(archived yet fast), the false "Yusr" that fooled the plain model, is now
correctly flagged as **Chaos**, leaving **Yusr a clean 9/9**. H5 is the operational
definition of *epistemic Shirk*: a network associating the wrong label ("alive",
fresh push) with its real state (rotting, high τ_v) — caught at p=0.0013.

## Do ADG/TQG-CFE address & advance Wolfram and Hoffman?

`python3 adg-tqg/experiment_wolfram_hoffman.py` tests four falsifiable claims that
map the telemetry onto Stephen Wolfram's computational-universe thesis and Donald
Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception. **4/4 supported on the 22 real repos:**

| # | Claim (Wolfram / Hoffman) | Operational test | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W1** | **Substrate independence** — matter emerges from information rules | `C_dev` from *pure* graph topology + timestamps (no funding/headcount/material) separates survival | surv 3.19 vs fail 1.18, **p=0.033, AUC 0.77** |
| **W2** | **Computational irreducibility** — no static shortcut; you must run the process | frozen popularity snapshot (AUC 0.75) vs running self-correction `1/(1+τ_v)` (AUC 0.83) | **process dominates by +0.08 AUC**; at scale the semantic `D_gap` snapshot is a full null (p≈0.735) while `τ_v` holds (p≈10⁻³¹, N=992) |
| **H1** | **Interface rendering** — perception is a fitness interface, not truth | TQG-CFE renders Ψ = Yusr/Usr/Chaos from alignment `A_n` | A_n **p=0.018, AUC 0.80**; Yusr **9/9** survive, Chaos isolates the mislabelled set |
| **H2** | **FBT persistence = linear decay** — *why* a non-veridical interface is stable, not just selected | regress vitality on fidelity `U·D`; adjusted R² picks linear vs quadratic | **adjusted R² prefers LINEAR (0.168 vs 0.154)** — graceful slide, not a cliff: the buffer that lets an interface coast on raw `U` |

**What this contributes.** Wolfram gives the *thesis* (reality is computational) and
Hoffman gives the *selection* theorem (fitness beats truth) — but neither supplies a
**measured dynamical law on real networks**. ADG/TQG-CFE do: substrate independence,
irreducibility, the fitness-interface render, and FBT's missing *persistence*
mechanism (linear, not quadratic, decay) all become numbers you can falsify. This is
a Layer-1 telemetry result; the physics analogy stays an analogy (no Layer-3 claim).
